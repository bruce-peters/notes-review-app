#Notes Reveiw App
This is a simple app that I developed over the course of a few weeks to solve a simple study problem

##The Idea
The original idea for this app was to create an app like quizlet that could help me study.
I had used quizlet in the past but it was only realy useful for me in classes like spanish, where one only needs to remember how to translate a few words (aka. only simple memorization)
I also realized that the best way that I found to learn this using quizlet was throught their Write Mode.
At the same time I was starting to use another website called Monkeytype more and more (the thought being that I would be able to type faster and thus take notes faster for humanities classes like AP World)
Then it hit me: What if I made an app that would allow you to memorize facts using a typing test like format.
In one of my hardest classes at the time AP World, I was struggling to remember all of the facts that we were learning and to synthesize my notes.
So I came up with a plan for this app. Take notes, extract raw facts out of them, and then put that into a typing test to help people memorize them.
I made a simple moc up, and it worked.
So, I decided to finish making the app and after some prompt engineering and perserveerence, I made it


(I know there are typos i'm to lazy to fix them)
